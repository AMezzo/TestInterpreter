## Scope of Work

Mark each of the requirements you completed by adding an X in between the square brackets. If you have any comments for a given section, add them in the "Comments from student" section (i.e. I almost finished this, but 3 tests aren't passing).

| Requirement                           | Completed?  | Comments from student                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------  | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Standard byte codes implemented    | [X]         | ByteCodes Implemented                      |
| 2. CodeTable implemented              | [X]         | CodeTable updated with all ByteCodes       |
| 3. ByteCodeLoader implemented         | [X]         |                                            |
| 4. Program implemented                | [X]         |                                            |
| 5. RuntimeStack implemented           | [X]         |                                            |
| 6. New bytecode implemented (DMP)     | [X]         |                                            |
| 7. Output correct (for byte codes)    | [X]         |                                            |
| 8. Output correct (for runtime stack) | [X]         |                                            |
